## AEAssist

A plugin which provides auto actions in combats. Different from other similar plugins, it's aimed for extreme trials, savage raids and ultimates. The action timelines are precisely refined for the purpose. Another characteristic is that users would have the access to high-end funtions only after contributing code to the community and being acknowledged. Now the plugin doesn't accept any new users but the invitation system is still operative.
