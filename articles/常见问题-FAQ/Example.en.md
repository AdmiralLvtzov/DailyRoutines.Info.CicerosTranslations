## 1. Q: **What should I do if I encounter a failure when downloading** `Daily Routines` through `Dalamud`
   - A: This situation is mostly caused by **local network or proxy issues**.  If network factors have been ruled out, you can enter` /xllog` in-game to check for red error messages. Then bring the logs to the #ask-for-help channel.
