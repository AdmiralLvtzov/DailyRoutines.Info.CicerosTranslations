### Authentication

- The Character IDs were deprecated due to its very limited function.
- The mini quiz in the Auth tab was removed.
- Elements in the tab will no longer be disabled before logging in.
- New text `About Auth` in the tab to provide a brief description regarding the authentication.
- The elements will be re-enabled precisely after the response retrieval from the server after clicking `Refresh`, instead of applying a fixed time interval before.
- The Bot Auth Token (Token Word) was removed since it's no longer required in the new authentication approach.

### Development

- We built the wheels `ObjectTable` and `TargetManager` from the scratch, since goatcorp has forbidden the access to ObjectTable from non-main threads.
- We also bulit the wheels of object classes with various ownership types from the scratch.
- If you'd like to access `LocalPlayer`, please refer to the path of `DService.ObjectTable.LocalPlayer` instead of `DService.ClientState.LocalPlayer`.
