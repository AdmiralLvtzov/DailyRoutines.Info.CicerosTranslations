## Module modifications

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [General]

- An issue of auto re-connection even if it's not during gathering has been fixed.
- The behaviours while taking off was optimized. The y-axis coordinate will be directly modified only when the variance on y-axis coordinate of the character is less than expected.
- The behaviours while dismounting was optimized. The module will attempt to land on any solid ground to dismount while there is no landable ground below.
- An issue that the module was unable to consume watered cordial and high quality cordial has been fixed.
- If the gathering nodes during special weathers is available for the current job of the character, the module will repeat the process that gathering these points, leaving the duty and re-joining.
- An issue that some consumables only need to be used once (like mounts, minions etc.) couldn't be purchased properly has been fixed.

### Field Operations Entry Command [System]

- New command parameter `ardorum` to enter the first scenario of Cosmic Exploration.
- Users now could copy the parameters by clicking parameters in the tables in the configuration interface.

### Auto Retainer Work [UI_Operation]

- New option `Modify Price (for all same items, Manual)`, to manually specify the price of all the same items which are sold by the current retainer.

### Better Party Finder Sorting [System]

- An issue of unexpected Party Finder display related to Blacklist has been fixed.

### Auto Commend Party Members [Combat]

- The code was streamlined and optimized.
- No commendation will be given after a duty run if self is selected as the commendation target.
- Better commendation logic for DPS:
    - If there are two or more players with the same job which is not the current job of the user character, these players will be set as the lowest commendation priority.
    - If there are players with the same role (like melee, ranged, tank and healer) of the user character, these players will have a relatively higher commendation priority.
