## Module modifications

### Auto Replace Action Animation [Action]

- Actions with empty names will no longer be excluded.
- Now the action ID will be displayed while selecting.

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [General]

- An issue that the character may be unable to dismount in some cases has been fixed.
- New wayfinding mechanism. If the coordinate remains 10 seconds after starting wayfinding, it will be considered as a vnavmesh failure, and a new attempt will be raised with new destinations.
- The logic of determining accessible items was optimized.
- The detection regarding the job level, the item level and GP was removed.
- The module will gather materials during special weathers only when the character level is greater than or equal to 81 and the item level is greater than or equal to 500.
- New gathering rotation for leveling up while GP is lower than 850 is now provided.
- The wayfinding logic was optimized. Now it will not directly target on the gathering nodes themselves, but somewhere around instead.
- The logic of gathering node interactions was optimized. It will now try to find new gathering nodes if it's unable to find the expected gathering node.
- The logic of Aetheromatic Auger execution was optimized.
- New configuration `Repeatedly gather clouded gathering nodes`, to repeatedly gather clouded gathering nodes by leaving and re-joining the duty. Disabled by default.
- Now the module will consider travelling by wind portals if the next gathering node is too far.
- The calls related to the module `Auto Discard Items` was optimized.

### Auto Discard Items [General]

- The logic of interface drawing was optimized.
- The logic of the discrad queue was optimized.
- The efficiency of item discard was greatly improved.
