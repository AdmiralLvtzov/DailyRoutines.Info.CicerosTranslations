## Module modifications

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [General]

- Now walking will be adopted if the distance between two gathering nodes is less than 20.
- The paths while the current job is a Botanist were optimized.
- The logic regarding gathering action intervals was optimized. Now it's no longer fixed which was 1 second in the past.
- The logic of moving via windmire was optimized. Actions will be proceeded 1 second after landing.
- An issue of invalid checks regarding the cap of skybuilders' scrips has been fixed.
- Now the module `Instant Logout` is a prerequisite module.
- According the above change, the logic of handling disconnection within the module will check login events instead of logout in the past.
- New state stuck detections were added. If no gathering interface 10 seconds after starting gathering, it will be considered as getting stuck. The module will try to re-login and start a new round.
- The threshold of interface stuck detections were decreased from 60 seconds to 45 seconds. New logic was introduced, which is no trigger conditions of gathering actions were acquired within 15 seconds. The module will try to re-login and start a new round as the response behaviours.
- New configuration `Always Wayfinding`, to only perform normal wayfinding, move via windmire and cast `Return` in the duty. Instant movement will never be performed, unless the character gets stuck in the terrain.
- New strategic logic regarding windmire. Now it will select the optimal movement method base on time cost instead of purely distance.
- The module description was updated according to the above.
- The priority logic of gathering nodes was optimized. Now clouded gathering nodes will always have the highest priority.

### Auto Discard Items [General]

- An issue of memory leaks on the interface has been fixed.
- An unnecessary logic applying delays was removed.

### Field Operations Entry Command [System]

- Now the module `Auto Skip Dialogue` is a prerequisite module.
