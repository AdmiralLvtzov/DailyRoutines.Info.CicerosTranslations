- An issue that the data of `Rogue` å’Œ `Arcanist` was hidden by accident has been fixed.
- The logic while approaching monsters was optimized.
- The threshold of checking if the character has entered the spawn range of certain monsters has been increased for acting in advance.

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [Script]

- Now if the character has to leave the duty for reasons, the current gathering or navigation will be terminated.
- The logic of checking if walking is faster was optimized.
- Now the entire process will be terminated if the character is not in The Diadem or the current job is not Miner or Botanist.
- The initial y-axis value of the map flag has been increased to prevent illegal values being passed to the vnavmesh plugin which often caused long time navigation.

### Auto Count Players Nearby [General]

- Now no notification will be triggered in any duty.
- Now the notification will be repeated after 30 seconds for a player continuously targeting the user.
- The count of players targeting the user will be displayed while there's at least one player targeting the user at the moment.
