## Module modifications

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [Script]

- The random delay before wayfinding was removed.
- The logic which controls the transition from jumping to flying was optimized. Now the character will ride to the next destination instead of flying if it's close enough.
- Now the module will try to `Sprint` while walking.
- The random delay before interacting with gathering nodes will be applied only after flying now.

### Auto Count Players Nearby [General]

- The pre-conditions of sending notifications were adjusted to that, the character is not in a duty or there's no party.
- The performance was improved.
- Now the chat messages from the players targeting the user could be highlighted by clicking the corresponding player.

### Auto Retainer Work [UI_Operation]

- Now the highest price among the history will be applied by default if no one is selling the item in the market while adjusting item prices.
