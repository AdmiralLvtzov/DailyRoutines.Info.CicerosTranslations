## Module modifications

### Auto Gather In The Diadem [Script]

- Now the character will only mount while necessary. And it's no longer a pre-condition of many operations internally.
- Now the path parsing will be completed before mounting.
- The threshold that the module will try to acquire precise coordinates of imprecise positions has been further increased.
- An issue of multiple notifications after a round of gathering has been fixed.
- Now the character will try to re-join The Diadem after disconnection even when the character is not in The Firmament.
- Now the module won't take the agency while the user manually interacts with the gathering nodes or travels via windmire in The Diadem.
- An issue of unexpected logic at the beginning of gathering has been fixed.
- Now the module will execute `Prospect` and `Triangulate` automatically.
- The default duration of a round is now 40 minutes by default.
- The drawing logic of the configuration interface was adjusted.
- The option `Gather Clouded Nodes Repeatedly` was deleted.
- The calculation of landing points around gathering nodes was adjusted.
- The internal logic was refactored. Three new modes `Leveling Up`, `Skyward Points` and `Clouded Node Gathering` were introduced.
- The `notification` section in the configuration interface was removed.
- New information floating window showing the current mode and related brief was introduced.
- Now the module will try to instantly move to somewhere above the gathering node instead of somewhere above the windmire if getting stuck.
- The optimized version of quick travels via windmire has been re-introduced.
- Now the character will no longer execute `Prospect` or `Triangulate` before leaving the duty while running the `Clouded Node Gathering` mode.
- Now the logic of amending coordinates before interacting with the gathering node was adjusted. The distance to be checked is now the distance between the character and the gathering node itself instead of the ground under the gathering node.
- The logic prevents GP overkill was optimized. Now the cordial will be consumed immediately while the option `Use cordial` is enabled and the cooldown of cordial ended, in order to maximize the efficiency.
- Some windmire coordinates were adjusted.
- The logic of getting stuck before wayfinding was optimized.
- The character will not leave the duty while the amount of Compressed Aether is enough to launch Aetheromatic Auger even if the time has exceeded the standard time of a round.
- The module will check the feasibility of the path at two-second intervals. If the path is not viable, it will initiate a new attempt of wayfinding.
- The character has a 30% chance to jump randomly per second during walking in order to simulate human behaviours.
- The logic of initiating wayfinding during wayfinding was optimized.

### Field Operations Entry Command [System]

- The logic of entering The Diadem was optimized.

### Better Item Storage And Retrieval On Retainers [UI_Operation]

- An issue that the item interfaces of some retainers could not be interacted has been fixed.
