## Modifications on Daily Routines

- Job switching could be executed if there's at least one corresponding Main Hand available. Creating a set before switching is no longer required now. This update has been applied to the job switching functions in all the modules.
- A authentication skipping mechanism based on GitHub has been introduced in order to provide accessibility during any downtime of the authentication servers in future.

## New modules

### Job Switching Commands [System]

Add a new command /pdr {0} < job ID / job name / job name in pinyin > (case insensitive, partial inclusive) to switch to the specified job.
