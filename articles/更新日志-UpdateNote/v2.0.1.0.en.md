## Modifications on Daily Routines

- A new reliable and efficient implementation has been introduced for `Skip Logos`.
- The computation of the font scaling feature was adjusted. Now it's more inline with that on Dalamud.
- The efficiency and memory footprint of the font building feature was greatly improved.

## Modules removed

### Optimize Actions With Long Cast Time [Action]

Since there are few actions with a cast time longer than its recast time now, the module didn't help as much as in the past. A similar module called `Customize Action Cast/Recast Time` has been introduced for user demands.

## New modules

### Auto Filter Log Message [System]

Automatically prevent log messages from being sent and displayed after proper configurations.
